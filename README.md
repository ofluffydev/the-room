# The Room

A small API project that serves a chat room with 0 authenticating and log in.

Build with Rust using Actix and Diesel.

It is configured to use pools to manage the database connections, since Diesel does not support async yet.

This means the schema generated by Diesel isn't even used, but it still can use `diesel migration run` to create the database.

# API Endpoints

## Get all messages

You can get all the messages in the chat room by sending a GET request to the `/messages` endpoint.

```http
GET /messages
```

You typically will use the last query parameter to specify the number of messages you want to get as shown below.

## Get the last X amount of messages

You can get the last X amount of messages by sending a GET request to the `/messages` endpoint with the last query parameter.

```http
GET /messages?last=10
```

## Send a message

This is a very simple POST request to send a message to the chat room.

```http
POST /messages
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "username": "John Doe",
    "message": "Hello, World!"
}
```
